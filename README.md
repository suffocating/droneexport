# droneexport
Automatically exports pictures and videos from a DJI brand drone.

Pretty self-explanatory.  Simply enter whatever drive letter the files on your drone are located.  Next, enter the drive you want to export them to and a folder name.

The program will create sub-folders for easy file management and will rename files if there a naming conflicts.

Folder tree looks like -> X:/NAME YOU CHOSE AS EXPORT FILE/YEAR/TODAY'S DATE/Pictures/(or /Videos/)
